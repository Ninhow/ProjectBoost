# ProjectBoost

[This project was created and programmed with a help of a Unity Course.](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/)

## Basics learned

* Getting player input with the help of `Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Key)`
* How to create menu options on the editor with the help of `[SerializeField]`
* How to create menu range options on the editor with the help of `[Range(startRange,endRange)]`
* How to get properties of the GameObject with the help of `GetComponent<Property>()`
* How to create debug keys for testing with `Debug.isDebugBuild` this will make sure that the test keys can be protected
* How to move around the levels of the game with `SceneManager`
* How to create FPS independent movement with the help of `Time.deltaTime`
* How to create movement by manipulating position, rotation and scale of a GameObject by accessing the property inside a script component
* Learned how to handle collisions and also adding tags to objects with the help of `Collision.gameObject.tag` i also think there should be a faster and better way to do this.
* Playing audio with components and also with code
* Leaned how to use particles and how to activate them with code.
